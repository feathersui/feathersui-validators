# Validators Services for Feathers UI

A port of the form validation classes from [Apache Flex](https://flex.apache.org/) (formerly Adobe Flex) to [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) for [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) and [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/).

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.2
- OpenFL 9.2
- Feathers UI 1.0

## Installation

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it from Github.

```sh
haxelib git feathersui-validators https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-validators.git
```

## Project Configuration

After installing the library above, add it to your OpenFL _project.xml_ file:

```xml
<haxelib name="feathersui-validators" />
```

## Documentation

- [feathersui-validators API Reference](https://api.feathersui.com/validators/)
